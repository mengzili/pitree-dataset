## About
We compile a new video with the following average bitrate: 1Mbps, 2.5Mbps, 5Mbps, 8Mbps, 16Mbps, 40Mbps.

## Test

The manifest file is located at [https://transys.io/pitree-dataset/video/Manifest.mpd](https://transys.io/pitree-dataset/video/Manifest.mpd). 

A quick test can be performed with the [DASH reference player](http://reference.dashif.org/dash.js/v3.0.2/samples/dash-if-reference-player/) by putting the manifest URL above into the player.

However, due to the rate limit of GitHub repository, we suggest users to clone the video files to their servers. For convenient downloading, we provide all links of video-related files in [this file](links.txt).

## Statistics

We provide the distribution of the bitrate of **each chunk** in the following figure:
